### Alexa config

In this tab is possible to config the device to work with Amazon Alexa.

## MQTT

MQTT is composed by subscriptions and message. A device is subscribed to a server using a topic. This topic is used to send and receive messages through it. ESPSimple uses two topics, one to send messages and one to receive messages. Once the MQTT is configured (enable, IP address and port) the strings used for subscriptions are automatically specified.

- Subscription strings, where XXXXXXXXXX is the board ID:
  - to send message to ESPSimple: "**IOT-XXXXXXXXXX-in**" 
  - to receive message from ESPSimple: "**IOT-XXXXXXXXXX-out**"
 
### MQTT Messages

ESPSimple uses JSON messages to receive requests and send responses to MQTT server. Every time one action is performed a message is send to MQTT informing about the action. It guarantees uniformity with all platforms using ([Homebridge](https://homebridge.io), [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org) and not using MQTT (Alexa, local actions, etc.).

# subscribe to iot-2653461020-out
#
mosquitto_sub -t iot-2653461020-out &

#
# send a message to topic iot-2653461020-in requesting to change to GPIO 13 to "high"
#

## Example configuring Alexa

Here is an example configuring ESPSimple and Alexa to create a lamp managed by Alexa.

**Note**: Alexa must be in the same network than ESPSimple.

## PWM

If you are using ESP32, ESPSimple uses hardware resources to create PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation). It guarantees a better precision for motors and dimmers.

PWM permits to define how much voltage will be send to the controlled device. In this case the devices can be from dimmers to motors, using AC or DC networks.

If you're expecting to use ESPSimple to control AC devices (lamp, fan, etc.) you will need to use a TRIAC (Triode for Alternating Current). It's a device that permits to control AC electric current using PWM. In this case is **HIGHLY** recommended to use a TRIAC with zero-cross support. It permit to ESPSimple to know when the INPUT AC electric current got and effect called "zero-cross" (when the frequency wave "crosses" the zero). It allows the system to create a great dimmer effect.

Below is an example of a zero-cross TRIAC device:

![AC dimmer module](https://github.com/tamusiunas/ESPSimple/raw/assets/AC_dimmer_module_15.png)

This device can be easily found on [amazon](https://amazon.com), [ebay](https://ebay.com) or [aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com). Search for "AC Light Dimmer Module for PWM".

**Note**: Since it uses AC electric current only use it if you know what you are doing!!

## Homebridge

[Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) implements the Apple Homekit protocol used by Apple Home apps. Once you have it installed you can integrate ESPSimple with Homebridge and use your Apple device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) to control your board. The integrations can be made using the MQTT protocol.
